                <h2>Indigenous Perspective in the B.C. Curriculum</h2>
                <p>The B.C. curriculum integrates Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives across all subjects through rationale statements, goals, big ideas, and learning standards. This fosters understanding of Indigenous peoples, supports reconciliation, and encourages meaningful discussions at all grade levels. The approach prioritizes B.C.-specific Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning. In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p><br>

<h2>First Peoples Principles of Learning</h2>
<p>The <em>First Peoples Principles of Learning (FPPL)</em> were developed by Indigenous educators and knowledge keepers in British Columbia. They reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and teaching, and they guide educators in integrating Indigenous perspectives into learning environments. These principles emphasize the holistic, experiential, and relational aspects of learning.</p><br>

                <li>Learning is holistic, reflective, experiential, and relational<br> (focused on

                    <li>Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.</li>
                    <li>Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is<br>sacred and

<h2>Identify Explicit Content</h2>
<article>
    <p>In B.C.’s redesigned curriculum, Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are integrated throughout all areas of learning and are evident in the curriculum’s rationale statements, goals, big ideas, mandated learning standards, and elaborations.</p> <br>
    <p>British Columbia's curriculum incorporates <em>Big Ideas, Curricular Competencies,</em> and <em>Content</em> that <em>explicitly</em> include Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives. This framework is designed to support teachers in authentically integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives into their classrooms.</p><br>

<p>Teaching students about Indigenous connections to the land is essential for fostering respect, understanding, and reconciliation. Indigenous Peoples have deep-rooted relationships with the land, grounded in knowledge, traditions, and stewardship practices that have sustained their communities for generations. By learning about these connections, students gain a greater appreciation for the land's cultural, spiritual, and ecological significance, helping them develop a sense of responsibility toward the environment and a deeper respect for Indigenous worldviews and histories.</p>
